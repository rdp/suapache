on true proxy run proxyServer.py
on miscreant run miscreantForwarded.py, apache.py on the port advertised

run echoAlien.py on host to setup mapping, then wget might work..

on alien after mapping  wget proxyServer:goodPort and it should connect you right through

todo add redir on the fly
save things to a DB?
complain when no match
only allow one miscreant with same name (reject!)

case of a recent close, an extra "miscreant closed" comes through, I believe. (quick in out broken)
msicreant doesn't seem to catch when other guy (proxy) dies...
seems to be a bug on first mapping...
