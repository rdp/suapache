todo add redir on the fly
save things to a DB?
complain when no match
only allow one miscreant with same name (reject!)

case of a recent close, an extra "miscreant closed" comes through, I believe. (quick in out broken)
msicreant doesn't seem to catch when other guy (proxy) dies...
seems to be a bug on first mapping...

bug: fire up miscreantProxy, kill proxyServer -- they don't die.
bug: go to a non existing miscreant, hit "reload reload reload" and sometimes it chokes. yeck?
todo rename everything yeck mapper middle man, endpoint

Todo: sometimes after awhile establishAlien no longer works...hmm...very very odd. [Roger will do that one]

Leave it for awhile then run it--doesn't get through but second time does (?)

Try it with the misc. on a bad port--allows download? huh? [needs to reject I guess]
