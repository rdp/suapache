jxta seems to be a NAT traversal protocol.  Seems pretty cool, with rendezvous servers to 'help' attach the servers who are unable to attach each other. This is the old paradigm, though cool.
Seems like this could be an interesting 'supplement' for certain progs.

p2p sockets is an attempt to use jxta to work with more standard things--seems to be the old paradigm. Requires a proxy running on localhost to have the normal web browser work with it, like ours. I think it may be 'superceded' by the latest version of jxta.
