# Random thoughts

= Introduction =
This is introduction material! Anyway code lacks 1) closing connections across the bridge  and 2) opening two ports.  Then, AFAIK it should work for limited use, especially with PHP. We can even host the PHP portion on planetlab1.byu.edu and just point there for setup, and it should just work for open communication on a few ports if you so desire it.

= Random thots =
Maybe could do SSH tunnel for the same effect?


= Security =
Enforce a EULA.
Tell them to only use a secure program that they trust.
It only opens (as of now) a few ports, so that's nice for security. It's punching a small hole through the firewalls :)

Could do username, password using diffie-hellman or "weak passwords" from the host--nice. Not yet necessary tell them to only use public things that are secure. Could be 'allow connection only once' or what not, to be better security.

Also could do: HTTP request at beginning, to fake out filters.
HTTP proxy guy.

Round Robin Fair Queue with a cap would be nice.

Using this system will not really 'hide' you from anyone, because the DNS queries (or web page login) must originate from you in order for it to work, so it is trivially trackable. This does not provide anonymity.
