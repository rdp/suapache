# Random thoughts

= Introduction =
This is introduction material! Anyway code lacks 1) closing connections across the bridge  and 2) opening two ports.  Then, AFAIK it should work for limited use, especially with PHP. We can even host the PHP portion on planetlab1.byu.edu and just point there for setup, and it should just work for open communication on a few ports if you so desire it.

= Random thots =
Maybe could do SSH tunnel for the same effect?

Username, password using diffie-hellman or "weak passwords" from the host--nice. Not yet necessary tell them to only use public things that are secure.
